# Learning goals

In this lab, you are expected to learn/put in practice the following skills:

- Evaluate whether a problem can be parallelized or not.
- Practice with the parallel package.
- Use Rscript to submit jobs
- Practice your skills with Git.

## Problem 1: Think

Give yourself a few minutes to think about what you just learned. List three
examples of problems that you believe may be solved using parallel computing,
and check for packages on the HPC CRAN task view that may be related to it.

Corss-validation in machine learning : carat, mlr
bootstrapping : boot
Monte carlo simulation : parallel
agent based modeling : parallel

## Problem 2: Before you

The following functions can be written to be more efficient without using
parallel:

1. This function generates a `n x k` dataset with all its entries distributed
poission with mean `lambda`.

```{r p2-fun1, eval = TRUE}
install.packages("microbenchmark")
install.packages("parallel")

fun1 <- function(n = 100, k = 4, lambda = 4) {
  x <- NULL
  for (i in 1:n)
    x <- rbind(x, rpois(k, lambda))
}

fun1alt <- function(n = 100, k = 4, lambda = 4) {
  # YOUR CODE HERE
  matrix(rpois(n*k, lambda=lambda),ncol=k)
  
}

# Benchmarking
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  fun1(),
  fun1alt(), unit = "relative"
)
```

2.  Find the column max (hint: Checkout the function `max.col()`).

```{r p2-fun2, eval = TRUE}
# Data Generating Process (10 x 10,000 matrix)
set.seed(1234)
x <- matrix(rnorm(1e4), nrow=10)

# Find each column's max value
fun2 <- function(x) {
  apply(x, 2, max)
}

fun2alt <- function(x) {
  # YOUR CODE HERE
  x[cbind(
    max.col(t(x)),
    1:ncol(x)
  )]
}

# Benchmarking; comparing how fast 
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  fun2(x),
  fun2alt(x), unit="relative"
) # 10 times faster!!
```

## Problem 3: Parallelize everyhing

We will now turn our attention to non-parametric 
[bootstrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)).
Among its many uses, non-parametric bootstrapping allow us to obtain confidence
intervals for parameter estimates without relying on parametric assumptions.

The main assumption is that we can approximate many experiments by resampling
observations from our original dataset, which reflects the population. 

This function implements the non-parametric bootstrap:

```{r p3-boot-fun, eval = TRUE}
my_boot <- function(dat, stat, R, ncpus = 1L) {
  
  # Getting the random indices
  n <- nrow(dat)
  idx <- matrix(sample.int(n, n*R, TRUE), nrow=n, ncol=R)
 
  # Making the cluster using `ncpus`
  # STEP 1: Make cluster
  cl <- makePSOCKcluster(ncpus)
  
  # STEP 2: set it up(export data ifneeded), idx, dat
  clusterExport(cl, varlist = c("idx","dat", "stat"), envir = environment())
 
  
  # STEP 3: THIS FUNCTION NEEDS TO BE REPLACES WITH parLapply
  ans <- parLapply(cl, seq_len(R), function(i) {
    stat(dat[idx[,i], , drop=FALSE])
  })
  
  # Coercing the list into a matrix
  ans <- do.call(rbind, ans)
  
  # STEP 4: stop the cluster
  stopCluster(cl)
  
  ans
  
}
```

1. Use the previous pseudocode, and make it work with parallel. Here is just an example
for you to try:

```{r p3-test-boot, eval = TRUE}
# Bootstrap of an OLS
my_stat <- function(d) coef(lm(y ~ x, data=d))

# DATA SIM
set.seed(1)
n <- 500 
R <- 1e4

x <- cbind(rnorm(n))
y <- x*5 + rnorm(n)

# Checking if we get something similar as lm
ans0 <- confint(lm(y~x))
ans1 <- my_boot(dat = data.frame(x, y), my_stat, R = R, ncpus = 2L)

# You should get something like this
t(apply(ans1, 2, quantile, c(.025,.975)))
##                   2.5%      97.5%
## (Intercept) -0.1372435 0.05074397
## x            4.8680977 5.04539763
ans0
##                  2.5 %     97.5 %
## (Intercept) -0.1379033 0.04797344
## x            4.8650100 5.04883353
```

2. Check whether your version actually goes faster than the non-parallel version:


```{r benchmark-problem3, eval = TRUE}
system.time(my_boot(dat = data.frame(x, y), my_stat, R = 3000, ncpus = 1L))
system.time(my_boot(dat = data.frame(x, y), my_stat, R = 3000, ncpus = 2L))
```

## Problem 4: Compile this markdown document using Rscript

Once you have saved this Rmd file, try running the following command
in your terminal:

```bash
Rscript --vanilla -e 'rmarkdown::render("[full-path-to-your-Rmd-file.Rmd]")' &
```

Where `[full-path-to-your-Rmd-file.Rmd]` should be replace with the full path to
your Rmd file... :).
